# IFES Dropout Machine Learning Study
Student’s dropout prediction for the Brazilian Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Espirito Santo using Machine Learning with Python.

# The Problem

Since the Brazilian federal anual budget for each Federal Institute of Education depends on the number of active students, the high levels of dropouts is a very big concern.

Our objectives for this ‘IFES Pilot Project' study is build a preliminary Machine Learning Model to process student's data available after the 1st year/semester in order to predict dropouts with high accuracy.

This pilot study is just the first step of a much bigger and complex data science project.
